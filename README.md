# Visual Tracking for Mobile Robotics

Visual object tracking is a field of study, that poses subject of intensive research since a long
time, which is motivated by its wide practical application, e.g. automatic surveillance systems,
human-machine interfaces or advanced navigation. For the purposes of this thesis the
automatic tracking module for mobile robotics has been developed. The designing process
required comprehensive and interdisciplinary literature research, introduced in chapter one.
The review of conclusions is presented in the next three chapters, including general theory of
object tracking, interrelated issues from the field of digital image processing and description
of algorithm commonly used in mobile robotics. Chapter four contains overview of existing
solutions. On the grounds of literature review, two algorithms were chosen for the further
development. The thesis describes two variants of system implementation, first based on
Lucas-Kanade algorithm, second based on CAMShift method. This variants are described in
chapter seven and eight. The methodology of selection is described in chapter six, which also
contains general project assumptions.
